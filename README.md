# wordle-fun
Welcome to my wordle solver! The algorithm works by finding the lowest average number of guessable words remaining after guessing some starting word
- Word bank: Wordle answer set
- Top word: raise
- Worst word: fuzzy
- Avg game length: 3.8 guesses

In the future I'd like to train an agent on this game and compare it's performance with the first method
