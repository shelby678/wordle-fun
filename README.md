# wordle-fun
Welcome to my algorithmic wordle solver! Here are this project's details:
- The program works to estimate the lowest average number of guessable words left after guessing any word from the answer bank
- The wordle answer data set (2315 words) is used as the guessable word bank (to be changed as this is technically cheating ðŸ™„)
- Top word: raise
- Worst word: fuzzy
- Avg game length: 3.8 guesses
